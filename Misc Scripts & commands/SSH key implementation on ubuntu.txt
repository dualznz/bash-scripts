Implementing SSH keys on debian(ubuntu) servers

First we need to make the ~./ssh directory:
sudo mkdir -p ~/.ssh

Next we need to make & add our ssh keys to an authorized keys file:
sudo nano ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
Then add your ssh keys to the file.

Next we chmod the ~/.ssh directory:
sudo chmod -R go= ~/.ssh

Next we need to chown the ~/.ssh directory:
sudo chown -R root:root ~/.ssh

Finally we need to modify the sshd_config file to allow password authentication:
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
Then find the following line:
PasswordAuthentication
Then change it from "no" to "yes"

After completing the above steps you just need to restart the ssh service:
systemctl restart ssh
