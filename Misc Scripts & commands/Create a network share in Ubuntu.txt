Create a network share in Ubuntu

First you need to ensure that samba is installed:
sudo apt install samba

Next you need to create a network user that will be able to access the shared directory:
smbpasswd -a username
Then fill in the required information to create the smb user.

Next you need to specify the directory location that you would like to share:
sudo mkdir /mnt/sharename

[Optional] you can chown the directory to a specific user account for read / write access:
sudo chown user:user /mnt/sharename

Next you will need modify the samba configuration file to add this new share:
sudo nano /etc/samba/smb.conf

Goto the bottom of the configuration file and add the following:
#share name
[share_name]
path = /mnt/sharename
available = yes
valid users = root #specify the smb accounts that can access this share
read only = no
browsable = yes
public = yes
writable = yes

Finally we need to restart samba:
For Ubuntu 16.04.x:
sudo service smbd restart

For Ubuntu 18.04 and above:
sudo /etc/init.d/smbd restart
